/* spu_interp.h — SPU interpreter: the correctness floor for the SPU recompiler.
 *
 * Statically lifted functions are the fast path. Computed/indirect branches
 * (`bi $reg`) and code that only exists at runtime — DMA'd overlays (LBP),
 * self-modified code (spu_0004's `stqd; sync; bi $3` trampoline at LS 0xC0) —
 * have no static bytes to lift. On a lifted-function-table miss we interpret
 * from live local store instead of falling off a cliff.
 *
 * The interpreter shares the EXACT spu_context (gpr, ls, channels) the lifted
 * code uses and calls the SAME spu_<mnemonic> helpers, so control and state
 * cross the boundary transparently.
