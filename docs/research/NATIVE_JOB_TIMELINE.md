# Native visibility job timeline

Issue [219](https://github.com/robbe1912/motorstorm-mv-recomp/issues/219) remains
open. The goal is stable 30 FPS through normal PLAY on Windows DX12 and complete
typed native x86 game operations. This checkpoint supplies a bounded recorder
and original publication/marker bindings. It does not install game hooks,
capture a job timeline, attribute frame cost or establish a speedup.

## Why a policy return is insufficient

The [scheduling comparison](NATIVE_SCHEDULING.md) distinguishes the persistent
host pool from native game tasks. One policy invocation can process several
jobs. The selected job can also finish executing before its output transfers
and marker publication finish. A single pair of policy-entry/return timestamps
cannot resolve those intervals.

Read-only original analysis now separates these stages:

| Stage | Verified original identity | Observation still required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Descriptor publication | PVS handler `0x87D858` calls through `0x87B814` to `MultiThreadSafeJobList::AddJob` at `0xC5C6A0`. | The successful 64-bit conditional store of the actual job header into an empty queue descriptor, not just function return. |
| Queue hint publication | The same AddJob path atomically maximizes the high halfword at queue `+0x10`, preserving its low halfword. | A separate successful 32-bit conditional store; descriptor and hint publication are distinct. |
| Requested lanes | The handler calls `SetReadyCount` through `0x87B854` to `0xC5BE20`, then the import trampoline at `0xD2A4E0`. | The real request and its owner/lifetime; inline guest publishers must remain visible too. |
| Host admission and execution | Current fork scheduler assigns a real policy to a persistent lane worker. | True eligibility, admission and worker start, separately from each selected job. |
| Selected running job | Policy running slot is LS `0x12E0`; its record is `0x1430 + 32 * slot`; physical lane is `0x1340`. | Running-record identity and generation at actual job entry. The newer claim index at `0x1410` is not this job. |
| Output/completion processing | Original transition `0x30B0..0x317C` moves the prior running slot into the store slot at `0x12F0` and calls the cleanup path at `0x3180`. | Execution end, pending output work and genuine release must be separate events. |
| Marker publication | Original code prepares the queue header, performs conditional MFC publication at `0x3330`, reads status and retries a failed store. | Only successful real commits establish marker publication; attempted writes and retries must not become completions. |
| Queue reuse | `JobListPrivate::ResetList` at `0xC5BF38` resets queue state and six lane counters. | A new queue lifetime/generation, including overlapping or uncovered resets. Marker values alone are reusable. |

The marker payload is the minimum marker among three remaining records that
match the selected queue, or `0xFFFF` when none remain. It updates that physical
lane's halfword at queue `+0x14 + 2 * lane`, preserving peer fields. This is a
queue progress counter, not a unique per-job completion message.

## Original evidence and coverage

The selected named-US ELF SHA256 is
`3e68c72f8fbd6a30ef30d4535462cf70f1cc86d111f56574adb7dd2c255e0706`.
The connected REA provider is unconfigured and does not admit this PowerPC/SPU
target. The existing manual, read-only Ghidra bridge was instead used on a copy
of the saved project, following [the established workflow](TRANSLATION.md).
All nine original project files retain their hashes; the owned bridge shut
down and its process exited. No project/provider configuration was changed.

Independent ELF mapping and original-byte comparisons qualify every export:

| Original entry | Symbol extent | Ghidra exact coverage | Independent original decode |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| PVS input preparation `0x87D348` | 984 bytes | 984 | 984 |
| PVS handler publication `0x87D858` | 372 | 372 | 372 |
| PVS wait `0x87D278` | 136 | 136 | 136 |
| AddJob `0xC5C6A0` | 136 | 36 | 136 |
| SetReadyCount `0xC5BE20` | 48 | 48 | 48 |
| Hint-max helper `0xC5BED4` | 68 | 68 | 68 |
| ResetList `0xC5BF38` | 156 | 156 | 156 |
| List initialization `0xC5D1C0` | 356 | 356 | 356 |
| ReadyCount import `0xD2A4E0` | 32 | 0 | 32 |

Ghidra's truncated AddJob flow and missing focused import export are retained
as coverage gaps. Complete independent linear decoding establishes the bytes
and atomic operations; it is not executed-path or ownership proof. Four actual
PPU thunks were also independently decoded to verify their destinations.

The raw policy source is guest EA `0x10135E00`, original file offset 16,539,136,
loaded at LS `0xA00`. The previously verified 168-byte dispatcher at LS `0x3008`
has SHA256 `796135f039c33420e25a13bca233d56e67e1f4a519f6206698747e09d66ee7ce`.
Across all 28 retained, SHA-verified worker contexts, all 2,064 words in
`0x1540..0x3580` match the original. The further raw candidate window has 138
unmatched words in `0x3580..0x37A8`; that staged region is excluded from original
code claims. The nearest preceding embedded SPU ELF was tested and rejected as
the policy owner. No missing match was repaired or treated as success.

An ignored private harness executes the original marker **arithmetic fragments**
with the production `spu_step` implementation. An independent scalar oracle
checks 4,096 authored record sets, all six lanes, three store slots, absent and
different queues, zero/sentinel markers and unchanged peer bytes. Deliberately
wrong header-offset and minimum-selection instructions both fail the specific
output assertion. Channel callbacks abort and none execute: this establishes
payload arithmetic, not GETLLAR/PUTLLC behavior, retries, whole-function
equivalence or live completion. An initial harness LS-pointer initialization
error was corrected before acceptance; failing logs remain in the packet.

The original files, generated instructions, saved contexts, read-only project
copy, verifier sources, build commands, hashes, logs and replay results stay in
ignored private packets under `temp/research/rea/job-lifecycle-20261023T195631`
and `temp/issue219-job-timeline`. Historical contexts correlate executing jobs
with unfinished waits; they do not measure current invocation mix or durations.
No new game run was needed for this checkpoint.

## Bounded recorder foundation

The authored [C/C++ API](../../vendor/ps3recomp/include/ps3emu/native_job_trace.h)
and [implementation](../../vendor/ps3recomp/runtime/diag/native_job_trace.c)
reserve immutable records with lock-free atomics, publish payloads with
release/acquire ordering and expose unfinished slots. Capacity is fixed at
creation, overflow never overwrites earlier events, and attempted/dropped
counts remain inspectable. Appending allocates nothing and performs no clock,
environment, formatting or file calls. A zero timestamp is explicitly invalid.

The owner supplies the clock domain, run ID, instance lifetime, dispatch and
queue generation. Storage does not invent those identities or dependencies.
Its live metadata is not an atomic final snapshot. Destruction requires all
producers and readers to be quiescent; setup failure must remain visible.
No recorder is created by the game at this checkpoint, so no new hot path,
environment option or scheduling behavior is enabled.

Run `python scripts/check_native_job_trace.py --mutants` to compile the actual
production implementation independently, compile a C++17 consumer, and test
16,384 concurrent authored events. A deterministic paused-writer seam checks
that a reserved slot is unreadable before payload publication. Four compiled
mutants must fail their own specific assertions: premature publication,
hidden loss, overwritten retained records and hidden invalid clock. These are
storage/concurrency checks, not an overhead or performance benchmark.

Fork-first commits and focused cross-platform CI are recorded in
[vendor provenance](../VENDOR.md). The production C/header are byte-identical
to the fork; only test/runner paths are adapted for this repository.

## Actual atomic-store observation hooks

The follow-up adds generic PPU32/PPU64 CAS and SPU conditional/unconditional
line-store observations. `PS3RECOMP_ATOMIC_OBSERVATION` defaults OFF; ordinary
builds preprocess out probe branches, buffers and clocks. An enabled build
still requires an owner to install immutable observers while producers are
quiescent. Installation failure must be reported. No game owner is installed
in this checkpoint.

PPU payloads use the actual CAS operands and returned observed value, in guest
byte order. Early reservation rejection remains distinct from a valid-memory
attempt and successful commit. SPU before/after payloads are copied under the
existing coherency lock; delivery follows unlock. A subsequent writer can
change shared memory without changing the retained observation. GETLLAR and
ordinary DMA are excluded from these store hooks. Existing notifications,
watch diagnostics, error reporting and reservation outcomes are preserved.

The owner supplies a monotonic clock and optional pre-copy filter. Clock and
delivery callbacks run outside reservation/coherency locks. Timestamp endpoints
bound the operation; they are **not exact commit instants or a total commit
order**. Raw saved PC/LR and context addresses do not establish instruction or
job lifetime identity. Filters must expose uncovered/excluded paths. These
constraints still apply when callbacks append to the bounded recorder.

`python scripts/check_native_atomic_observer.py --mutants --syntax` extracts
the actual production CAS/store functions and compiles them with authored
VM/reservation/diagnostic dependencies, in both build modes. It also syntax
checks the complete production SPU translation unit in both modes. Tests cover
success/failure, lost reservations, both scalar widths, all three SPU store
commands, invalid ranges/context/clock, rejected filters, lock release,
preserved peer notifications and a deliberate later writer. Five compiled
mutants must fail their specific assertions: false scalar completion, late
payload reread, hidden clock failure, false SPU completion and delivery under
lock. LLVM-MinGW functional checks and Windows SDK checks pass locally; this
is not full reservation-coherence, live timeline or capture-overhead proof.
Separately, the complete public PPU translation unit passes Windows SDK syntax
checks in both modes with the actual selected generated header read-only.
This is not a full target link or native run.

The public fixture explicitly retains curated-only watch/alias dependencies
and the existing line-hook notification path; it does not import the fork's
independent taskset notification. Selective runtime patches invert exactly to
the original public modules. Fork provenance and cross-platform checks are in
[VENDOR](../VENDOR.md).

## Execution observation checkpoint

The fork-first `PS3RECOMP_EXECUTION_OBSERVATION` option defaults OFF. Its public
runtime definition also reaches generated units compiled in the linked CMake
target; separately compiled units must use the same setting. The ordinary
build discards probe arguments, branches and clock calls. No game owner installs
an observer or captures a timeline yet.

Enabled observations cover actual interpreted control transfers and conditional
fallthrough, interpreter invocation, accepted native operation begin/end,
compiled return macros, selected dispatch after interrupt routing, and final
resolved indirect calls. The final resolver retains its required Clang
`musttail` call. Native admission and existing instrumentation guards remain
unchanged. A native END follows a valid continuation; faults/unwind do not
receive a fabricated completion event.

These boundaries have different meanings. Interpreter invocation can admit a
native operation before interpreting anything. A dispatch event precedes the
selected call, rather than proving its first instruction executed. Interpreted
control events identify the executed source instruction and resulting PC;
compiled returns lack precise source attribution. Raw pointers, image IDs,
saved PCs and accepted native logical PCs are not job/lifetime identities.
Uninstrumented units, direct calls and missing events remain coverage gaps.

Install/clear requires synchronized producer quiescence and immutable callback
lifetime. Callbacks must be concurrent-safe and must not mutate guest state,
reenter execution, allocate, format, perform I/O or take application locks.
Filtering runs before clocks and event construction; exclusions require explicit
coverage accounting. The owner supplies one clock domain and accounts for
invalid clocks, ordering, dropped data and capture windows.

`python scripts/check_spu_execution_observer.py --mutants --syntax` compiles the
actual public interpreter, observer core and return/dispatch macros with authored
streams and dependencies in both build modes. The curated drain differs from
the fork: its exact interrupt-selection/call slice runs inside an authored loop,
and the actual final resolver slice retains `musttail`. This is not full IRQ or
coherence equivalence. Unexpected channel/VM recovery services abort.
The public runtime uses its existing inline float helpers; the fixture does not
import the fork's separate floating-point implementation.

Eight compiled mutants must fail specific assertions: missing interpreted
control, forced interpretation, missing dispatch, missing return, wrong
interrupt-selected function, missing resolved call, repeated return-register
expression and hidden invalid clock. LLVM-MinGW functional and Windows SDK
functional/full-production syntax checks pass, including a C++ header consumer.
The existing hash-pinned pre-port equivalence, native-leaf state/FP/TLS/IRQ tests
and their negative controls also pass. Only observer additions are undone in
that reference reconstruction; its original digest is unchanged. The ownership
fixture passes 18 checks with its existing cross-image wildcard diagnostic
visible. These checks measure neither capture overhead nor game frame times.

## SPURS admission and worker observations

The default-OFF `PS3RECOMP_SPURS_SCHEDULER_OBSERVATION` option can expose real
instance reservation/result/closure, workload registration/removal, policy
admission and worker invocation/return. It assigns nonwrapping process-local
instance, workload-generation and dispatch identities. Exhaustion yields zero
and an explicit invalid-identity flag. A capture owner must supply a run identity
and one shared monotonic clock. Thread-local access identifies the current host
worker assignment; it does not establish that an arbitrary SPU context or job
belongs to it. A direct policy call outside the pool has no such assignment.

Admission metadata is copied under the existing scheduler locks and delivered
after their release. Its time interval starts before the admission pass acquires
the instance lock and ends after release. Multiple admissions share a pass; a
worker can begin or return before that pass is delivered. Ready/signal values
are sequential demand observations, not proof of job eligibility. Policy return
is not individual job completion. Failed or BUSY lifecycle API attempts are not
reported as completed transitions; successful instance closure retires its
remaining workloads. Filtering, clock failures, unknown bindings and missing
events must remain visible. Callbacks must not reenter or mutate the runtime,
allocate, format, perform I/O or take application locks.

The authored fixture executes the real scheduler and policies in both build modes.
It verifies physical lane and lifetime identity against the actual policy context,
reuse and exhaustion, direct-call absence, filtering, actual error returns and
same-thread lock witnesses. Nine compiled observer mutants and the three existing
scheduler regressions must fail their particular assertions. The test dependencies
are authored scaffolding, not proof of full game synchronization or capture cost.

## Remaining integration gates

1. Connect the atomic, execution and admission observations above to a capture
   owner and bounded recorder. Preserve native-leaf admission
   and all original failures. Event
   capture must not run guest work, allocate, format or take application locks.
   Qualify precise source attribution in interpreted and lifted paths: a lifted
   block's saved PC alone does not identify every channel instruction inside it.
2. Bind this game's original code, queue lifetime, selected running record and
   actual output release. Distinguish attempt/commit, policy/job and store/end.
   Uncovered inline publishers, reused identities, missing edges, clock
   failures, overflow and partial windows must remain explicit.
3. Exercise those actual hook paths and the game analyzer with authored
   wrong-owner, generation-reuse, missing-publication/completion, reversed-time
   and overflow controls. Storage tests alone do not cover these obligations.
4. Measure tracing overhead separately before one coordinated original-asset,
   muted, screen-gated normal-PLAY run. Retain unsuspended CPU/present timing
   before optional intrusive diagnostics; observe the original menu and race.
5. Choose publication-aware admission only if eligible work waits, or a complete
   typed PVS batch if execution/marshalling dominates. The existing native PPU
   scene transaction is a different operation. Never sum overlapping waits as
   exclusive costs or treat unknown edges as a complete dependency graph.

Stable30 and graphics acceptance (#27/#137), the critical producer's frame-time
cost (#155), and this timeline (#219) remain open. Vulkan and retail mstream
remain parked. Neither the recorder nor this static binding makes the game
faster by itself.

### Complete observation payload storage

The fixed job-trace record cannot hold an entire atomic observation. The new
bounded sized store accepts an owner-selected fixed payload size and preserves
each payload in one release-published slot, without fragments, allocation or
I/O on append. It exposes pending slots and saturating loss counters, never
reuses a slot, and requires producer and consumer quiescence before destruction.
The owner must define the schema, clocks, run and lifetime identities, and
interpret losses; this store does not supply any of those. It is not yet
connected to a game capture. The actual store fixture tests full authored atomic
snapshots, concurrent writers, pending publication, loss, counter saturation,
and odd-sized records; four compiled controls must fail specific assertions.

The game-side `job_capture` owner now connects the four installation points to
the sized store with one supplied clock and run ID. Each record includes a
thread ID and, when available, the current host-worker assignment. The latter
is not proof that an arbitrary observed context belongs to that worker. Failed
installation rolls back earlier installations; startup and shutdown require all
producers to be quiescent and no other observer owner. Optional owner-provided
atomic, execution and scheduler filters execute before event capture. The owner
reports which filters were configured and saturating per-source exclusion counts;
excluded events are missing coverage, not proof of absent work. Filters must be
concurrent-safe and obey the observer callback restrictions. Null accepts all.
Finite capacity and loss must be accounted for in any capture.

The owner also provides a caller-thread private stream snapshot: a header,
indexed completed records and a footer containing the before/after counts,
pending slots, filters and losses. The reader checks the format, record indices
and total extent before delivering records. Truncated files and consumer errors
are rejected. The format uses the native ABI, has no payload checksum, and
`fflush` is not a durability guarantee. The caller owns the stream and must
close and independently preserve it; game startup and a live trigger before
guard termination are still required. The view remains non-atomic and cannot
establish missing job dependencies or a causal order.

An explicit visit API scans the initial reservation horizon and records pending
slots, consumer failures and metadata before and after the scan. Unexpected
append failures use a saturating counter; full-store losses use the store's drop
count. It is a live,
partial view; callbacks can arrive out of order, writers can complete after a
slot was scanned, and the layout contains native ABI fields rather than a
portable file format. The actual owner fixture checks concurrent complete
payloads, installation rollback, identity flags, loss and partial visits, with
five specific negative controls. A second fixture links the actual execution and
scheduler observer implementations; the atomic installers there are authored
test dependencies. No game startup, durable capture, game-specific job identity,
overhead measurement or native run is provided by this owner yet.
