# WWS policy, ownership and CPU evidence

WWS job-list header uses hexadecimal offsets: policy-module EA +0x0, policy-module byte length +0x4, BE16 hint +0x10, taken +0x12, six BE16 minActive markers +0x14. PM atomic publication sites 3180/32FC/3330. PPU wait is genuine. Native main SPURS 4003F380 with five physical SPUs/wids 0..3; audio 1027DC00. Heap EAs vary; 108D0100 is reservation payload, not a module (observed module 100E6F80).

## Post-incarnation native PVS binding, 2026-10-13

After PR #80, muted normal-PLAY run `20261013T164817.294475Z` still stops
presenting at malformed MOHAWK bike selection (last internal frame 79).
Eight screen-gated receipts acknowledge English, Sony skip, PLAY, help,
ticket, Anything, class and attempted MOHAWK confirmation. Skip correlation
is 0.9682716418. Consumption is not scene-transition or gameplay proof.
EXE SHA256 is
`c360957f7496b66bf931673dd137deae21ef6a0e3213f71cef62b44f09b6b4a4`,
with the matching named-US ELF/launch-US data. PM interpretation is required;
all six wedge probes are zero; sampling is `RSX_CAP=1:480:25`. Duration guard
closes at 301.469s, return code 1. Stderr SHA256 is
`57e2ad5be1ca2795526f68a9b622803fe26e3b063a293a1b2ed20f260797c234`.
There are 1,656 accepted explicit EXIT records, no task-ID exhaustion and no
unresolved-indirect line within this bound. Earlier errors remain evidence.

Exact EXE/PDB/dump CodeView and metadata-only unwinds place main native thread
31124 at `JobListPrivate::StallForJobMarker` through `PVSPPUThread::Wait`,
scene rendering and `ShadowMapModule::GenShadowMap`, rather than the earlier
Havok completion semaphore. A CFG-dominating RSI=entry-RCX assignment plus
restored nonvolatile register proves the actual PPU context argument. Two
sequential live reads, about 40.68s apart, bind guest thread 1, object
`0x40044410`, queue `0x40044480`, requested marker 8, hint/taken 8 and
minActive `[FFFF, FFFF, 6, FFFF, FFFF, FFFF]`. Neither is an atomic history
or captured producer operation.

The same argument proof at `spu_pm_interp_trampoline` binds native thread
11568 (`spurs_pm2`) to registry slot 6, physical SPU 2 and local job records
6/7 for that queue. Three complete 256-KiB local stores spanning about
183.34s have identical SHA256
`15af0ff61c2dffa2fca46eb38fbea07fb866a70e97a703c18bc8d81acbfa7518`.
Third unwind stops at an unsupported leaf; no third trampoline-frame claim
is made. Context diagnostic PCs are not executed instruction PCs. Private
records are `postexit*_stall_snapshot.json`, matched unwinds,
`postexit1/2_pvs_wait.json` and `postexit2_producer_binding.json` beneath
`temp/runs/20261013T164817.294475Z`.

This satisfies issue #8's conditional trigger without identifying the first
missing producer operation or proving a Havok relationship. Next evidence
must distinguish job-6 execution, retirement and shared-marker publication.
Exonerated CPU spans stay closed; #71 remains separate; retail mstream stays
parked. No native race, graphics correctness or frame-time acceptance.

### First chronology probe: physical ownership changes

Read-only probe run `20261013T170551.582315Z` used EXE
`a0a1e74da3f9dc765425f19761315f4bbd9b2fe269498ec58778780a72b3d2bb`,
normal acknowledged input/intro skipping, queue filtering and physical SPU 2.
Its authored fork fixture verified unchanged context, LS and synthetic guest
memory, filtering and retained observation after a local retirement clears
its job record. Native trace contains 998 filtered fetch records: local
marker 6 clears and the shared active markers become all FFFF. That is
positive evidence for this wave, not proof that the whole PVS wait completes.
A later matched operand capture still has requested8/min6, now on physical
SPU 3; its local records are 6/7. The SPU-2 filter excludes this later owner.
The queue address/marker number alone must not identify a unique job lifetime.
Snapshot chronology and these filtered records cannot establish whether this
is a new submission or ownership handoff. Broader observation must preserve
context and actual physical identity across the same queue.

The 181s guard terminates with return1. Stderr SHA256 is
`d4c55043bc8a0b80fc578bdca95a73dcc50dd0740db198f51eaca1fb4707673d`.
Private evidence is `producer-final-summary.json`, `chronology1_pvs_wait.json`
and context/LS files. Neither probe timing nor retirement establishes a race;
probe-off baseline above remains authoritative for the ordinary stall.

### Second chronology probe: all-physical filter and cap

The second private observer run `20261013T171346.818831Z`, EXE SHA256
`eda1c840c3b39ec60e2e198d94887c719ec5dfa465725864682d25ad1b13221b`,
admitted all physical SPUs on the same queue and retained an armed context
across policy-mode changes. Its 20000-event interpreter budget exhausted on
one context, physical SPU 0. Local marker 6 clears, and both publication sites
are fetched twice; the sequential shared header changes from hint8/taken8 to
hint2/taken1. Queue address and marker alone therefore cannot identify a unique
submission lifetime. No matched late wait capture was made in this run, and
absence after the cap has no verdict. Internal frame 71 still shows malformed
blue geometry at SELECT A BIKE, not gameplay. The 181.046s duration guard ends
with return1. Trace SHA256 is
`288c35aceefd36007dc9aa391e98e8456746b92db50138fe3b22d6011560189d`;
stderr SHA256 is
`79e378e657135b9f86e2de4d4d03c139fc7a66dfe03ccf01b1bb41520e3fa7fa`.
All three temporary runtime hooks were restored byte-for-byte in both trees;
the supported optimized rebuild succeeds with EXE SHA256
`d767b40e2ace342d60ccaa7623cf272863f2a2848a4af1f6a09d337a62b5cb0a`.
Private summaries and EXE/PDB pairs are retained. No producer correction or
race acceptance follows from these observations.

### Published clipping fix: fresh PVS binding (2026-10-13)

The clipping correction in own PR #87 removes the oversized environment
triangles, but does not establish completion of vehicle loading or normal PLAY.
Supported optimized build `20261013T195103.541804Z` produces EXE SHA256
`61b74e4d10efcdaf7f38a9a87be8b14c60097c85f1713f2fbe3948a01a8249ff`.
A private layout program compiled against the current SPU/PPU headers independently
matches the stored offsets and sizes (268,960 and 1,104 bytes). No temporary
runtime hooks are installed for this capture.

Muted named-US run `20261013T201913.840310Z` follows the ordinary observed route,
including an observed Evolution skip and acknowledged MOHAWK confirmation.
After 30 seconds, bounded read-only sampling produces a minidump, matched
EXE/PDB CodeView admission, actual-PC metadata unwinds and sequential live reads.
Main native TID 39524 is in `JobListPrivate::StallForJobMarker` (`C5C424`) through
`PVSPPUThread::Wait` (`87D278`). The CFG-dominating RSI=entry-RCX assignment and
restored Windows nonvolatile register bind PPU context `0x489B52F670`, guest
thread 1. Object `40044410` points to queue `40044480`; requested/hint/taken are
8/8/8, active markers `[FFFF, FFFF, FFFF, 6, FFFF, FFFF]`, minimum 6.

The PM trampoline argument proof binds TID 32932 (`spurs_pm3`) to context
`0x22300539280`, registry slot 7. Its captured LS independently identifies
physical SPU 3 and queue `40044480`, with local record words 6/7. The context's
`spu_id` field is 0; neither that field, registry slot nor thread name substitutes
for the physical-number proof. LS SHA256 is
`2271d01b108b487de42e7399e3f3984e458c59016d40424caebd477ef3a1b593`.
All 22 registered contexts were covered without registry truncation. Diagnostic
context PC `2178` is not promoted to an executed guest instruction. The actual
native producer unwind reaches `interp_run_until_impl` and the PM trampoline.

Explicit stop at 108.688 seconds terminates the owned run with return 1. Stderr
SHA256 is `49113434d6ea0e69990a2634ddab438ef520b893134367205dbbca955a924d53`.
Eight acknowledged inputs do not prove a race successor. This single snapshot
and later live reads are not atomic, a unique-submission identity or instruction
chronology; they do not identify the first missing operation. Issues #8/#13/#24
remain open, #71 remains separate and retail mstream remains parked. Next trace
the late producer's state transitions and submission lifetime without allowing
early interpreter-fetch churn to exhaust coverage. Existing compared CPU spans
remain scoped and are not reopened by this binding.

Two preceding attempts yield no memory evidence: run `200352.667867Z` rejected
the diagnostic log's reserved evidence prefix before creating a dump (explicit
stop at 106.625 seconds); corrected-log run `200854.236002Z` timed out after
English, missed caption gates and exhausted its finite internal-capture budget
during the intro (explicit stop at 201.047 seconds). Both failures are retained.
The successful run adds a validated private observed-movie optional gate, but
uses the existing Evolution gate; the new movie gate is not runtime-verified.

### Marker-state and SPU-copy journal (2026-10-13, issue 8)

A private read-only observer was developed and compiled first in the own-fork
checkout, using ignored curated-source copies. Its state key excludes fetched
PC, scratch fields and event-mask churn; a shared context cache deduplicates
replacement host threads. It observes two local marker words, shared header,
image/policy and queue association, with one-second same-state samples. Separate
callbacks run after successful plain PUT and successful atomic PUTLLC/PUTLLUC
copies. Their source bytes and post-copy header are observations, not a total
write order: unreserved/PPU writes can race those reads. PPU/direct writes are
not instrumented, and context-address equality is not submission identity.

The first observer opened a journal for every short-lived host thread. Run
`20261013T205225.932877Z` exhausted CRT file handles, failed an asset open and
exited before navigation at 2.141 seconds (return 0). This observer-induced
failure is not game completion or a PVS diagnosis. The replacement uses one
synchronized journal. A synthetic current-header fixture checks guest/context
immutability, 100,000 unchanged fetch sites and 1,000 replacement host threads;
the final cache retains two marker states plus one copy record rather than
logging thread creation or instruction churn.

Run `20261013T205422.903989Z` still exhausted 50,000 events early: 48,883 state
changes and 1,117 SPU-copy callbacks. Its later matched wait was requested 8,
hint/taken 8/8 and minimum 6 at active index 4, with a PM trampoline argument
binding for `spurs_pm4`. The trace does not cover that later wait; no absence
after its cap is evidence. Explicit stop was 108.688 seconds, return 1.

The revised run `20261013T210006.781660Z` arms only after observing PLAY, then
acknowledges the ordinary route and MOHAWK confirmation. EXE SHA256 is
`e02c98a7a37b3cff558eb35fed464e9574c52156b62a542ebe8cb9f55ddf6bd5`.
It retains 30,559 events below its 50,000 budget: 25,074 marker-state changes,
5,375 successful PUTLLC-copy callbacks and 110 same-state samples. The final
observed header is hint/taken 10/4 with all six active markers FFFF; it is
sampled repeatedly across 15.2601949 seconds (QPC frequency 10,000,000). The
last captured successful publication also observes that header. Matched
EXE/PDB/actual-PC unwind and sequential live reads bind the main PVS wait to
requested 8, taken/minimum 4, all active markers FFFF. Explicit stop is 86.625
seconds, return 1. This differs from the earlier minimum-6 condition and directs
this probe's next question toward claim/eligibility for the next queued jobs.
It does not identify the first missing operation, prove continuous stability,
name a unique submission, or explain the uninstrumented baseline: diagnostic
serialization and timing can change which condition appears.

Trace SHA256 is `af7441316d5061406267f7bfa2fa20ec6aed16d28ac591f21689b9db10564f30`;
stderr SHA256 is `63128529fbd1e5c3bd28bba5ee69ffbef835378704545b081f5c1c18417f9714`.
The matching final EXE/PDB and observer source are retained privately. All three
temporary native sources were restored byte-for-byte; the own fork's tracked
tree remained unchanged. Supported optimized baseline rebuild produced EXE
`76e08e48b34d5aca500879287d82828194f9f86a6d8ed943114a88de0570bb41`.
No wait was bypassed; native menu/race acceptance remains open. Issue 71 stays
separate and retail mstream stays parked.

### Filtered boundary history (2026-10-14, issue 8)

The next issue-8 probe distinguishes retained allocation, release followed by
reallocation, and independently changing descriptor state. It does not reopen
the already-replayed allocator arithmetic or authorize clearing occupied pages.
Own-fork `codex/spu-boundary-history` commits `e9954e3`/`c619594` add a generic,
opt-in callback after actual interpreter fetch and before decode. PC/policy and
an optional big-endian LS-word filter precede bounded per-context capture. Each
record retains all GPRs and a configured LS range, with matching sequence/commit
markers; the reader reports gaps, incomplete replacements and overwritten prefix.
Payloads remain private. Authored C/C++ filter/wrap/concurrency/torn-record checks
and actual-interpreter callback-removal red/green pass. Linux and Windows hosted
workflows pass at exact `c6195945c40d9d708293090cbf0bb62221ff3919`.

Only the shared header and two interpreter insertions were temporarily overlaid.
Diagnostic native EXE SHA256 is
`cd8ea77e473c57a9d1eacd93240a3ec9851e79b4f7287067342544321dfbe2da`.
Configuration selects audited allocation/reset/removal/release/retirement
boundaries, queue word at LS 13F0 and range C00--1BFF, capacity 1024 per context.
A first controller preflight failed on an unavailable historical reference,
before input. Replacement profiles use only retained original BMPs whose SHA
matches an acknowledged receipt; thresholds were unchanged. Subsequent muted,
owned runs acknowledged observed intro skips and normal MOHAWK confirmation,
then stopped explicitly. No desktop control or scene jump occurred.

Run `20261014T114659.393992Z` observes 15 seconds after confirmation. Its
same-dump main requests 4 on object `0x4004C510`; the later queue `0x4004C580`
read has hint/taken/minimum 4/4/4 and no active marker. This is not the conditional
blocked PVS case, nor proof that it cannot occur later. The configured repeat
extends the post-confirmation observation window to 60 seconds; observed intro
timing still differs between runs. Run
`20261014T115033.457459Z` recaptures object `0x40044410`, request 8; later queue
`0x40044480` has hint/taken 8/8 and lane-3 minimum marker 6.

Exact-image unwind and the unique CFG-dominating RSI=entry-RCX proof bind native
TID 28056 to context `0x2A3005CC480`. Independently decoded LS identifies physical
lane 3 and local markers 6/7; thread name and registry slot 20 are not this proof.
All 5120 retained observations across five rings match independently hashed
original-ELF instruction words at their recorded PCs. The admitted producer ring
retains sequences 37266--38289, 1024 records, no gaps or invalid slots; 37265
prefix records were overwritten. In 252 same-TID, adjacent-PC before/successor
pairs, observed map-store bytes match the prior GPR value's architectural
big-endian encoding: 42 pairs each at 1B04, 1B0C, 2CFC, 2D00, 314C and 3150.
This constrains those stores, not every intervening instruction or writer.

A final retained witness, entirely on native TID 23320, includes retirement
stores reducing occupied pages 253 -> 112 -> 24, then allocation restoring
24 -> 165 -> 253, followed by the next local-job reset with occupancy still 253
and local records 6/7. The corresponding callback sequence is 38249--38289.
Thus the observed tail contains release followed by reallocation, not simple
never-released retention. It does **not** prove the new allocation is wrong or
should be freed while job 6 remains active. `late_boundary_admission.json` and
private `analyze_boundary.py` retain hashes, source checks, paired effects,
witness sequence and qualifications.

The full producer tail spans 96 native TIDs; a retained context address is not a
lifetime or submission identifier. Sequences order committed preexecution
callbacks, not instruction retirement or cross-context execution. Later suspended
LS has the same final page maps but differs elsewhere in the captured range.
Do not collapse these observations into one atomic state. The next discriminant
is job/service return and completion versus retirement/publication, not another
replay of the exonerated allocation arithmetic. The first missing progress
operation remains unproved.

Both final native images retain desert/sky/menu text, ground artifacts and no
bike or race. No visual, gameplay or performance acceptance follows. Exact
instrumented PE/PDB copies were archived. Private offline helpers now accept an
explicit archived image without weakening EXE/PDB/dump or module-identity gates;
the archive reproduces the same producer proof after relinking, while the new
nonmatching current image is rejected. Temporary interpreter bytes were restored
exactly, the verified header removed, and the supported noninstrumented build
passed (EXE `112c219f13f1a849119a34219aa6bf138331904b0c3b085fce43fb77b8e3bef6`).
This is still the off-main policy-argument trial; issues 8, 24 and 13 remain open,
71 stays separate, and retail mstream stays parked.

### Policy workload argument trial (2026-10-14, issue 8)

Issue [8 evidence](https://github.com/robbe1912/motorstorm-mv-recomp/issues/8#issuecomment-6158109859)
precedes the production edit. This remains an unfinished native trial with run-dependent visual results,
not completion of issues 8, 24 or 13.

Baseline `20261014T001553.193625Z` retained 256 hardware write hits and two
stopped-event dumps for slots 4/5, with clean register restoration/detachment.
Dump `701aa7ab44a17e429de5c300379e43bb5e43a80f61e5d986313268415dd6c864`
matches baseline EXE `76e08e48b34d5aca500879287d82828194f9f86a6d8ed943114a88de0570bb41`.
Actual TID 14252 unwinds from memcpy through `mfc_do_transfer`, MFC submission,
`spu_wrch`, interpreter and PM trampoline: a normal SPU DMA PUT missed by PPU
text-watch coverage. The CFG argument proof binds context `0x220806100B0`.
The exact native caller's straight block stores restored nonvolatile R15 to
argument 5 and immediate zero to argument 8. Same-dump stack arguments 5--8
are `[0x40044480, 1, 0x4003F380, 0]`: workload data, workload ID, SPURS EA,
supplied SPU number. Incidental register values are not physical-SPU proof.

Original policy entry shifts r4 to select the low word as job-list EA; its
optional initializer separately uses the first word and can PUT all ones at
that EA plus its progress-lane offset. Duplicating the low workload word into
both words incorrectly enables this initializer on the job-list object.
Restored opcode/source agreement alone does not prove the exact executed SPU PC.
Fork atomic `680f097` packs scalar u64 high32/low32 in words 0/1, clearing 2/3,
as its taskset path already did. The actual-store authored fixture fails three
low/high/mixed cases on both old sources and passes five cases after correction.
Only this block was selectively ported; PM interpretation/resume stay intact.

Supported native build yielded EXE
`8b5cbaf6b177d7c1f317c60da6d5e60bae514802f5689880743ca72dca60c1eb`.
Run `20261014T003245.274483Z` acknowledged the observed intro skip and normal
MOHAWK confirmation. Its bounded watch retained 256 zero-valued writes, no
nonzero slot-4/5 hit and clean cleanup; this is not all-writer absence proof.
Later entries 0--7 are contiguous, hint/taken 8/8. The same-dump PPU requests 8;
later active lane 4 is marker 6. PVS remains blocked. Final internal frame 71
has intact menu text/logo over black, while baseline frame 67 shows the desert.
Neither shows a bike/race. **The native trial stays off main.**

Matched TID 26428's PM trampoline binds context `0x205805BC540`. Later registry
slot 21 / LS identifies lane 4, queue `0x40044480`, local markers 6/7. Original
publication span 3180--33A7 matches byte for byte, SHA256
`82d1e523af70c1c6b0e7c89b4b0f61ab83bba9e184d7ccbedca5e3b659ab6714`.
The native sample in `mfc_for` through `spu_wrch` is not a deadlock proof.
Compiler-derived layout matches the 268,960-byte captured context; later tag
mask/status are both 8, not evidence of an incomplete selected tag then.
The first missing progress operation is still unproved. Reads remain sequential;
registry slot, diagnostic PC and `spu_id` do not identify an executed instruction.

Unwatched repeats `20261014T005334.421649Z` and
`20261014T010410.695354Z` use the same corrected EXE and display the desert again,
with ground artifacts and no bike/race after normal MOHAWK confirmation. Thus
003245's black background is a retained observation, not a consistently
reproduced packing regression or proof that hardware watching caused it.
The trial remains off main.

The first external MFC collector reached its 128-overflow-node capture cap;
136 engine files are not a demonstrated list cycle. The matching compiled PDB
independently confirms engine size 520, slot size 528, overflow size 536/next
at 528, and command size 32/active at 28. The revised bounded collector preserves
partial owner metadata on failure and permits 4096 overflow nodes. During a
requested process suspension, 010410 captures all 8 inline plus 460 overflow
engines with unique owners and a terminated chain. Retention alone is not a leak
or a stall cause. The controller always resumes the process before stopping it.

Exact-image unwind binds TID 28208's PM trampoline to context `0x260804B6CC0`.
Original-byte-verified LS identifies physical lane 1, queue `0x40044480`, local
jobs 6/7. Its unique engine is idle (queue count 0, no active commands), with
all tag completion bits set; context mask/status are 8/8 and list-stall fields
are zero. The same-dump main requests 8; the queue read during suspension has
hint/taken 8/8 and lane-1 minimum marker 6. These observations exclude pending
engine commands or a missing selected completion bit **at this captured stop**;
they do not prove instruction chronology or exclude historical ownership races.
`late_mfc_producer_admission.json` retains hashes, PDB admission, owner mapping
and temporal limits. The first missing guest progress operation is still open.

Private artifacts include `data-watch/workload-data-callsite-admission.json`,
`late_producer_admission.json`, exact-image unwinds, original-byte disassemblies,
watch logs, receipts and both final images. Runs were muted/owned and explicitly
stopped. Earlier resource-guard/controller/identity failures gave no writer proof.
The generic observer subtracts the FILETIME epoch as an integer before division,
retaining exact identity without tolerance; authored write/new-thread/dump/detach
and no-hit-deadline regressions pass. Observation changes timing.
Exact PE/PDB copies are preserved before future relinks. A private archived PE
with matching CodeView but different timestamps was restored in a new copy to
the full recorded baseline SHA; the archive was untouched and identity gates
were not weakened. CodeView alone is insufficient binary identity.

### Queue contracts and uncapped PPU watch (2026-10-14, issue 8)

Read-only REA queries reused the existing named project in disposable copies;
original project hashes stayed unchanged. Independent original-ELF comparisons
give complete decoded symbol coverage for `Init` (`C5D1C0`, 89 instructions),
`CheckJobList` (`C5C094`, 45), `ResetList` (`C5BF38`, 39) and `InsertHole`
(`C5C7CC`, 35). Job headers begin at queue+0x20, stride eight. Ordinary inserted
holes have type 3, not an all-zero header; `CheckJobList` stops at a zero type.
The queries of `AddJob` and `AddNopJob` each leave 100 symbol bytes undecoded;
neither is claimed complete. Private evidence is under
`temp/research/rea/existing-20261013T232237` and `...232247`, with independent
verification JSON. Earlier pilot exports used stale focus addresses and are
not evidence for these contracts.

The retained marker-state run `210006.781660Z` has zero headers at slots 4/5,
populated slots 6..9 and hint/taken 10/4. This differs from earlier minimum-6
captures and does not establish corruption, an intentional hole or its writer.

Two following muted runs use baseline EXE
`76e08e48b34d5aca500879287d82828194f9f86a6d8ed943114a88de0570bb41`
and the same named-US target. The existing PPU watch covers 256 bytes from
`40044480`. Its records precede plain stores; 64-bit stores are split into two
records, while store-conditionals report success. Host function names can alias
through identical-code folding; guest LR/TID are separate caller evidence.
This is not all-writer coverage or a global commit chronology.

- Run `20261013T231549.081046Z` exhausted 20,000 prints before PLAY; no later
  absence follows. Explicit stop: 100.765 seconds, return 1. Its old helper
  associated the dump's native PC with later live guest registers and returned
  an unrelated object/request. Discard that live binding. The actual dump holds
  object `40044410`, requested marker 2, guest thread 1. A later fixed-address
  queue read has hint/taken 8/8 and all markers FFFF; these are different times.
- Run `20261013T232053.780391Z` removes the print cap and retains 57,154 PPU
  records, including 8,809 after the recorded MOHAWK-acknowledgment byte bound.
  Those later records include 207 reset-counter/marker sequences with guest
  LR `67396C`, and further submissions with LR `87D9A4`, all guest TID 1.
  Thus this instrumented run continues queue work after confirmation; it is
  not evidence of an immediate permanent wait. The dump-resident context later
  requests marker 8 on object `40044410`. Sequential queue samples have
  hint/taken 10/10 and active markers `[FFFF, FFFF, 4, 5, FFFF, FFFF]`.
  Slots 4/5 are populated here. Explicit stop: 98.703 seconds, return 1.

The latter run's stderr SHA256 is
`e18fbd8b88d232504783f8b0f78de8371a77b80e37aba493f0fc1028304645e3`;
dump SHA256 is `6c4dfccf3eb169258722dbe668d2a29a1e62297dd7320d34eba790772d236c5f`.
Private `ppu_watch_analysis.json`, `dump_context_binding.json` and the preserved
route receipts identify the analysis. Its final internal frame 65 shows the
recognizable desert environment and logo but no bike. The user confirms the
environment looks broadly right with remaining artifacts and that the original
vehicle should drive up the hill. Neither the entrance animation nor a race
successor is observed. The PVS wait is not yet established as the missing-bike
cause; diagnostics can change timing and the observed marker.

The private marker helper now takes guest GPRs from the matched minidump's
captured context, refusing missing/ambiguous memory instead of falling back to
live registers. Its regression reproduces the real old object/request mismatch,
recovers both retained contexts and rejects absent/truncated/invalid inputs.
Earlier retained 164817, 201913, 205422 and 210006 object/request bindings agree
with their dumps. Object/queue reads remain later sequential observations;
no whole-process atomicity follows. See the reusable [capture rule](../OPERATIONS.md#bind-registers-to-their-capture).
No runtime source or native build changed in this analysis. Next distinguish
the late producer's execution/publication from repeated queue reuse before
choosing a semantic fix. Issues #8/#24/#13 remain open; retail stays parked.

### Productive IRET incorrectly classified as idle (2026-10-14, issue 8)

Archived boundary run `20261014T123214.478534Z` retains a final same-native-thread
sequence from policy dispatch `3094` through wrapper `16270`, job main `4030`,
kernel reset and IRQ save/restore, ending at IRET `AFC`. Original ELF windows
independently identify the final job occupant; earlier reused high-LS addresses
are not assumed to contain that module. Later context reads report continuation
`4118`; these are sequential observations, not a complete instruction trace.
The archived EXE is `cd8ea77e473c57a9d1eacd93240a3ec9851e79b4f7287067342544321dfbe2da`.

Changing only `SPU_PM_IDLE_BAIL` from 4 to 64 in run
`20261014T123852.029726Z` retains two same-thread adjacent selected `AFC` ->
`4118` witnesses in an intact ring. A fifth ring has an invalid slot and is
excluded. This threshold change is diagnostic, not a fix or race acceptance.

The curated interpreter's IRET-bail handler counted repeated continuation PCs
as idle and called `spu_halt` after five returns without pending events, despite
productive intervening guest execution. The own-fork interpreter lacks this
heuristic. An authored CPU-only program increments r80, IRETs repeatedly to
the same continuation, and reaches its own STOP after eight increments.
`python scripts/check_spu_iret_progress.py` compiles the actual interpreter and
headers: the old curated source fails at five increments with synthetic park;
the corrected curated source and fork pass eight increments, PC `118`, STOP
status 2, no park. Unused channel/lift/recovery adapters abort. This tests the
idle classifier, not complete IRQ register restoration or the game pipeline.

The selective correction removes that classifier, retaining existing IRQ
restoration/redispatch and the IRET diagnostic counter. Own-fork regression
commit `719ea0d` is included in combined `20b1384`; exact-head hosted checks
pass. No external PR was opened.

Supported optimized build EXE
`0c9997e061264243efeb62e99e769653987bdd9c4f959f875b5046e9ad32c156`
ran muted with normal observed intro skip and menu/confirmation inputs in
`20261014T125147.523683Z`. Main TID 7656's matched snapshot unwinds through
`cellGcmSetWaitFlip`, not the expected `C5C424` marker frame. One sample does
not establish a new deadlock or permanent PVS recovery. Final internal frame
121 still shows SELECT A BIKE, desert, malformed ground/hill and no bike/race.
Explicit-stop terminal: 182.860 seconds, return 1. Boundary recorder and the
threshold override were absent; existing bike/filesystem diagnostics remain.
Issues #8/#24/#13 stay open. Raw evidence and original instructions stay private.

## Earlier native producer binding

The muted normal-menu run `temp/runs/20261012T230343.828131Z` reproduces the
wait with the AA-corrected EXE SHA256
`3822b2341dbbf26e670189cb392a00b680a56434aa8c58f5860c784967177fc2`.
Frame 25 shows race selection with distorted yellow/black/white bands; frame
30 shows the bike menu with a white central scene. The user reports selecting
the bike. Only LANGUAGE-English CROSS4 has an automated receipt; the external
screen-gated controller observed race selection, but did not acknowledge the
other planned inputs. This is assisted normal-menu observation, not a fully
automated route or a playable race.

Matched EXE/PDB metadata unwinds and freshly compiled context offsets bind both
`bike1` and `bike2` samples to requested marker 8, minimum 6, queue
`0x40044480`. The actual trampoline argument binds native thread 34576 to
physical SPU 2, rather than treating a registry slot as its physical index.
The process remained alive and rendering stopped. The launcher subsequently
terminated it at its 600-second bound: final return code 1,
`terminated_by_guard=true`. That termination is not proof of an earlier game
crash. Both guarded captured-wait analyses report BLOCKED with exit 2.

REA's unchanged Java bridge queried a disposable read-only copy of the existing
named Ghidra project, with the original project hashes unchanged. Private
evidence is `temp/research/rea/wait-20261013T011515/verification.json`.
Independent original-ELF byte and symbol-bound checks give full coverage for
`StallForJobMarker` at `0xC5C424` (84 bytes), `WaitForJobListEnd` at `0xC5C478`
(220), `PVSPPUThread::Wait` at `0x87D278` (136), the unblended scene-list
renderable at `0x6C379C` (428), and `CommandListBuilder::FinalizeJob` at
`0xC5BA68` (72). `RenderCommandExecutor::Execute` at `0x7765B0` has 192 of
200 symbol bytes decoded; the eight-byte gap and unresolved caller identities
remain qualified. This is the manual bridge path described in
[translation methods](TRANSLATION.md), not supported Windows ELF CLI admission.

The original names and matched native frames locate the wait in scene
rendering through `PVSPPUThread::Wait`; they do not identify the missing SPU
operation. Test three alternatives with a bounded chronological producer
trace: job 6 has not returned; it returned without reaching retirement; or
retirement ran but the queue publication did not persist. The earlier probe
exhausted its budget before this marker, so its missing events do not distinguish
these cases. No forced retirement, repaired execution, Havok causal link or
performance acceptance follows.

The muted run starting at 2026-10-10T22:40:10Z stopped at the malformed MOHAWK INDIANA bike menu. Only three of four recorded PAD_FILE presses were acknowledged; the race-start press remained unconsumed. This is a menu stall, not a verified race-load attempt. No Havok fatal or playable race occurred. EXE SHA256 was `627f27bd2c03c8cec5c496bb8b9373630e916a7ec339396537ce0d0b8f6b1195`, using the named-US debug ELF and launch-US disc. The matched EXE/PDB CodeView identity and prelaunch config/userdata identities remain private.

Two matched minidumps, with sequential guest/LS samples 80.741 s apart, bind the wait to native thread 31380. PE unwind metadata reaches C5C424 through actual sampled native PCs. The matched executable's argument-spill instructions locate its PPU context without scanning candidate pointers: r3 is 0x40044410, r4 requests marker 8, and r8 is queue 0x40044480. The sampled object pointer at r3 +0x4 agrees. Both queue samples have hint/taken 8 and minActive `[FFFF, FFFF, FFFF, FFFF, 6, FFFF]`; their identical SHA256 is `8ea4f17d008a10a974529a14a4eadf218ec9e21264c49b736ebfcb209c7e11fd`.

The same metadata procedure binds native thread 27668's `spu_pm_interp_trampoline` argument to registry context slot 21. Its LS field at 0x1340 records physical SPU index 4, corresponding to the queue's active marker 6. Registry slot 21 is not a physical SPU number. Its job records at LS 0x1450 and 0x1470 reference this queue and markers 6 and 7 respectively. Queue descriptor 6 points to command-list EA 0x4C6AAA00, with descriptor word 0x00500001 specifying 80 command bytes. The manager EA is 0x10135E00.

The two complete LS reads for that context have SHA256 `38e0edbd1441eb5af9a509f4fe5e7156142fccb26d896f05e63bf8f91ccd8e0a`. Their diagnostic context PCs differ (0x1A20 and 0x2C88); these fields are not promoted to actual sampled guest instructions. The original ELF's PT_LOAD mapping independently supplies the 11136-byte policy at file offset 16539136, SHA256 `44c7436c82f40ced9377ed6abf3293d6792e70e1b34923c4572bb2a3fcc4d616`. Its load base is LS 0xA00. Both captured publication spans 0x3180..0x33A7 match those original bytes, without reinterpreting the previously exonerated CPU spans. A private offline check reports the captured blocked wait with exit 2 for both samples; this checks the actual captured context/header relationship, not a repaired execution.

[Issue #8](https://github.com/robbe1912/motorstorm-mv-recomp/issues/8) remains open. The outstanding job and active native producer are identified, but sequential reads do not establish instruction or writer chronology. The next trace must distinguish an unfinished job/service, a returned job without retirement, and retirement whose queue publication did not persist. No wait bypass, runtime fix, Havok causal link or performance result follows from this binding.

## Chronological probe limits

The isolated muted probe starting at 2026-10-10T23:30:06Z stopped explicitly after 108.375 s. Its EXE SHA256 was `62c0bcbcd733a9cf527e875743494679f57c9f46ac86a98721a4e571cf984197`; sampled dump, EXE and PDB CodeView identities matched. The observer recorded 100000 actual fetched instructions for queue 0x40044480 on physical SPU 4, all matching the independently mapped original ELF policy bytes. The trace includes 171 visits each to publication sites 0x3180 and 0x3330..0x333C, but its job-record markers are only 0, 1 and FFFF. The budget exhausted before the requested-8/job-6 case. These early publication visits do not establish the missing operation in that later stall.

Screenshots reached language selection; one eight-poll CROSS was acknowledged, followed by a black screen. Normal PLAY, race load and Havok failure were not reached. This diagnostic run reused compiled game objects and added read-only runtime observers; it is neither a clean-build proof nor a performance measurement. An earlier probe was rejected because its file sharing and thread-ID reuse caused capture failures. Corrected disabled/enabled/filter fixtures verified no context or LS writes, but they do not replay the game defect. The temporary runtime hooks were removed, and matching sources, binaries, identities, traces and dumps remain private. A narrower marker filter was prepared but not run; its coverage must be validated before drawing absence-of-event conclusions. Issue #8 remains open.

## Allocations and retention

Initial reserved pages 0..15 and 248..255 = 24. Reserve C00 at 108D0100 requests 16..156 = 141; C10 at 9D580100 requests 157..244 = 88. Union 253, only 245..247 free. PM allocation commit 1B04/1B0C writes page maps, 1B14 descriptor, 1B1C command; new-job reset 2FA4..2FF8 clears selected descriptor/gather/logical maps **without clearing page maps**. Growth 1FF0/1FF4/classification 1FF8/1FFC; baseline removal 2CFC/2D00; release 20CC/20D8/20DC; retire 3130/314C/3150.

Later interrupt chronology demonstrates real 24→165→253 allocations. A zero descriptor plus retained map is not automatically a host leak: incomplete history cannot justify page clearing or a root-cause claim.

## Bounded independent replay

| Unit | Inputs/checks | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership commit/reset/release | 77/39616, 0 fail: 17 commit/12 reset/48 release | Canonical-byte scalar oracle, full 128 GPR/full LS, actual span bytechecked |
| Reservation predicate 2C34 continuation → 2750 → 1AB0 | 35/110, 0 fail; LS unchanged | Actual start 157, length 88 intersects retained maps: r18 FFFFFFFF, original refuses → 2178 clears r10 → 1A1C |

Tests use literal original instruction fixtures and stay private. They exonerate tested spans/inputs, not helpers beyond the span, concurrency, lifetime or the full freeze. Initial bad test constants/types/math assertions were oracle/setup errors, not architectural failures. SELECT service keeps LS 1DC id and resumes r0 link; a “wi->0” diagnostic did not mean interceptor wrote wi_state 0.

Owner-read gate captured four owning-thread beforePC 1A40 snapshots across 45.281s with identical complete LS SHA256 f0a3b6372f699744582ddd3d2de49c651399d967ec163408fad180af01277e77, matching authentic PM bytes. PPU stalled ~166.5s; queuehint 2/taken 2/minSPU 4 = 1, other markers FFFF. Snapshots are not instruction chronology. Establish original provenance/live history rather than reinvestigating exonerated CPU spans.

A/B scheduling cap 2/burst 16 observed 18–22 presents/s vs cap 4/burst 1 at 26–27; defaults 4/1 retained. This is a diagnostic window, not a 60FPS benchmark, full-game improvement or license for title-specific scheduler policy.

## Combined-build stall confirmation (2026-10-11)

In the [combined review run](../OPERATIONS.md#combined-review-validation-2026-10-11),
the user reported confirming a bike to start, but the observed screen
remained SELECT A BIKE. HOTREAD diagnostics again reported queue/object
0x40044480/0x40044414 and LR 0x87D2D4. These diagnostics are not a fresh
actual-PC unwind or proof of consumed start input.

Two read-only 1024-byte queue samples, taken more than 30 s apart after
matching owned PID/create_time/executable and validating guest VM bytes
against the selected ELF, are identical. Both decode hint/taken 8 and
minActive [FFFF, FFFF, FFFF, FFFF, 6, FFFF], with the same SHA256
`8ea4f17d008a10a974529a14a4eadf218ec9e21264c49b736ebfcb209c7e11fd`
as the earlier bound producer capture. This reproduces the blocked header
state with the reviewed diagnostics combined; it does not prove identical
producer history or identify the missing operation. No Havok fatal was
captured. Issue #8 remains open for the already planned narrow chronological
trace; the exonerated instruction spans are not reopened.

## Marker-6 observer refinement, 2026-10-11

Private read-only hooks ran against the current runtime. Four fixture modes
verified disabled/wrong-queue exclusion, marker arming/retirement, caps and
unchanged full context/LS. First run `20261011T133917.527458Z` exhausted
100000 fetch records in14.105 s and reproduced the earlier8/min6 queue hash;
no later absence can be inferred. Publication visited predecessor5 while6
remained active.

Refined run `20261011T135119.578937Z` compressed loop samples by command/LS
state; other GPR changes lie outside that loop identity. It retained2008
selected fetch records over5.314 s and44 full context/LS pairs. Every recorded
instruction matched original policy SHA256
`44c7436c82f40ced9377ed6abf3293d6792e70e1b34923c4572bb2a3fcc4d616`.
Embedded and separate LS copies agreed for all44 pairs. Snapshot quota44
exhausted; later transitions are unobserved. Retirement shows253 ->112 ->24
reserved pages; allocation24 ->165 ->253. A later worker wave clears local
marker6 and visits publication; persisted shared-queue publication and the
first missing operation in previous stalls remain unproved. No new blocked
PPU/producer PE unwind was taken.

User bike confirmation transitioned to black, then original fatal177 at
235.578 s. Probe timing differs; this is not a fix, speedup or PVS/Havok causal
proof. Hooks restored byte-for-byte, diagnostic EXE/PDB retained privately,
all61 preserved generated-source hashes unchanged. Ordinary use requires
rebuilding restored runtime. #8 remains conditional/open; the exact failing
bytes now advance #1/#2 and #3. No exonerated CPU span was reopened.

## Running pipeline record in saved producer captures (issue155)

Offline reinspection of the protected `20261021T115255.306059Z` producer
packet resolves the earlier policy-index ambiguity. The dispatcher has three
32-byte records at LS `0x1430`, `0x1450`, `0x1470`. It transfers the pending
slot at `0x12D0` to the running slot at `0x12E0`, then selects the record at
`0x1430 + 32 * running_slot`. The selected record carries the queue, flags
and marker at offsets 0, 4 and 8. Physical lane `0x1340` is separate from
the packed dispatch word at `0x1350`; the latter combines the 16-bit rotation
of the workload word at `0x1400` with the selected marker. LS `0x1410` can
already describe a newer claim and must not identify the executing job.

The 168-byte dispatcher span matches the selected original ELF uniquely at
file offset 16,548,872 and maps through its outer `PT_LOAD`; this does not
make policy provenance offset `0xFC5E00` an embedded ELF header. All 42
decoded dispatcher instructions match original bytes and the same span in
28 SHA256-verified saved contexts. In all 28, the selected record marker
matches the separately sampled physical lane counter, the queue agrees
with captured GPR52, and the captured PVS PC window matches original module
bytes. Two historical same-cycle main-minimum examples are cycle310,
PC `0x858C`, running slot0/marker32 versus next index38; and cycle670,
PC `0x8F9C`, slot0/marker32 versus next index41.

The durable private verifier is
`temp/issue155-producer-span/verify_saved_dispatch.py`, with results in
`verified-dispatch-binding.json`. Worker suspension freezes its saved
context; main/queue reads remain sequential, not an atomic process snapshot.
These captures predate the native hierarchy replacement. They bind those
historical visibility stalls, not current exclusive CPU cost or frame time.
Together with [current native wait timing](../NATIVE_GAME.md), they select
visibility work for a native candidate. The sampled loop contains plane-like
float/FMA comparisons against eight coefficient triplets; inspected counts
are five or six. Full input ownership, numerical semantics, output/ABI parity
and current invocation still require proof before replacing that operation.
