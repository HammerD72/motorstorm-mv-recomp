# Run storage and retention

On 2026-10-21 the user selected **only the newest five runs** for the active
`motorstorm-convolution-capture` checkout. That checkout opts into count-based
retention with ignored `temp/run-retention-policy.json`:

```json
{"mode": "latest", "keep": 5}
```

The launcher applies this policy before startup and after owned shutdown. A
running sixth capture may temporarily coexist with the five previous runs.
Unlike the older conservative policy below, this explicitly discards older raw
diagnostics, screenshots, failures and dumps regardless of age or pins. Store
reusable menu reference images outside `temp/runs` before opting in. Small
top-level JSON identities/gates and deletion receipts remain under
`temp/run-receipts`; these do not reconstruct discarded captures. Native process
ownership and junction protection still apply. Dry-run or apply manually with:

```powershell
python scripts/prune_latest_runs.py --repo E:/GitRepos/motorstorm-convolution-capture
python scripts/prune_latest_runs.py --repo E:/GitRepos/motorstorm-convolution-capture --apply
```

Checkouts without that local policy retain the earlier conservative behavior:

User-approved policy (2026-10-15): keep the newest **10** runs; expire only
otherwise disposable, completed runs older than **14 days**. Documentation,
replay references and unique evidence take priority over age and disk pressure.

## Automatic maintenance

The supported `scripts/run.py` invokes maintenance **before** creating the next
native process. This needs no scheduled agent, tokens or background service.
It operates only on that checkout's `temp/runs` and writes a run-retention JSON
receipt under `temp/`. No game process is killed by maintenance.

The launcher refuses a new native run below **16 GiB** free and its existing
owned-run resource loop stops below **8 GiB** free. It logs `disk_available`
alongside RAM/commit observations. These limits stop capture growth rather than
silently deleting protected evidence. The low-disk pre-launch path has an
authored red/green test against the real launcher, with no game process created.

For another checkout, or for an explicit report:

```powershell
python scripts/prune_runs.py
python scripts/prune_runs.py --repo E:/GitRepos/motorstorm-convolution-capture
```

Default CLI behavior is a dry run. Add `--apply` to execute the same policy.
The main-checkout launcher hook does not change an older worktree's launcher.
The API rejects limits below14 days/newest10; CLI overrides cannot silently
weaken the approved policy merely because the drive is filling.

Protection is conservative:

- Any live native process prevents maintenance. A still-live recorded PID also
  protects its run; missing or unreadable identity/finalization is not disposable.
- Root Markdown, docs, scripts and private profiles pin referenced run IDs.
  The profile supplied to the launcher is additionally pinned, even if outside
  the checkout. Keep externally referenced evidence with a `.keep` marker or a
  private JSON file containing `{"retention_pins": ["RUN_ID"]}` under `temp/`.
- Failed replay, unexpected termination, fatal/OOM/exception output, dumps,
  shader/binary payloads and authored source are retained. This is not a proof
  that an unreferenced run has no future research value: pin it when in doubt.
- Junctions/symlinks are never followed. Paths are checked against the explicit
  repository/run boundary, including immediately before unlink/rmdir.
- Before removing any eligible run, all non-capture payloads and manifests are
  archived under `temp/run-archives/`; ZIP CRC is checked. Only BMPs inside
  `rsx`/`present` are omitted. The archive explicitly says it lacks capture data.
  Protection is re-evaluated before deletion. Archive failure aborts deletion.
- Sources, Git history, game inputs/keys, generated target trees, userdata/saves,
  current executables, and unrelated E-drive applications are not cleanup targets.

Archives themselves are not automatically expired. Review them separately;
do not pretend a metadata archive can reconstruct discarded screenshots.
Remote issue-only references cannot be discovered offline: pin those explicitly.

## Immediate space relief without losing evidence

NTFS `compact.exe` can losslessly compress **finished** capture trees and the
deprecated Rust build cache. This preserves logical bytes, file paths and hashes;
it is compression, not deletion. Validate the exact roots, refuse reparse points,
and verify no native/Cargo/Rust process is writing them first. Keep tool output,
free-space before/after, and sample hash verification in ignored audit evidence.
After recursive compression, clear compression on the top-level `temp/runs`
directory **without recursion**, so future captures do not inherit compression
and add unnecessary runtime capture overhead. Existing compressed runs stay so.

The old `motorstorm-pacific-rift-rust/bevy/target/debug` is an ignored,
rebuildable Cargo cache; source and diagnostics outside it are not the cache.
Host policy rejected the initial recursive deletion request. Do not evade that
block with another deletion mechanism; it is distinct from lossless compression.
The old repository also has pre-existing migration changes: do not mistake them
for disposable source or attribute them to the later agent without provenance.

## Regression

`python scripts/check_run_retention.py` uses only authored temporary repositories.
It exercises metadata-before-delete, archive failure, live PID/native protection,
reference and stale-plan pins, source/dump/failure retention, age/newest policy,
and a real Windows junction (symlink on other hosts) whose external file survives.
It never exercises deletion against private game runs.
